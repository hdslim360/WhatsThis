# Code Review For Group 7
## __**09/11/17**__

### Greetings! I will be assisting you and your program as you progress through the semester. 

* Code reviews support the Agile Process. It helps maintain working software, improves collaboration and interaction among team members, 
  and helps deliver overall better programs.

* I will check in periodically to see how your program is going, and provide any insights if I have them.

* Status: No Program 
* The earlier you get started, the higher the odds that you will complete your program.
* Start by pushing up an outline of what the vision is for the program. This will help you and your
  team members move towards a single endpoint, and help flush concepts and issues out early.
